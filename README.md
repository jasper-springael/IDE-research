This is an open-source IDE developed by microsoft which seems to include a lot of functionality despite being **free**. It's compatible with the most importantant OS's: **Linux, Windows, MacOs**. It's fast, has a **clear UGX**, which is modern and customizable, and a lot of **useful extensions**. There are alternatives, which are mentioned below, but at the price point it really seems a winner.

>*__Quote from an independent third party reviewer:__ VSCode feels super awesome for day to day coding and writing markdown blog posts. Its indentation, snippet execution and bracket matching simply work and donâ€™t get in your way.*
